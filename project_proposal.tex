\section*{Project Description}
This project involves building a checkers game in MIPS. Specifically this project will use SPIM for the 
backend and Python to generate a GUI and input to SPIM. The project will involve a few parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item State Machine:

\item Datastructures:

\item Checkers AI: The checkers AI will implement an Alpha-Beta search algorithm which will evaluate
moves based on metrics that include taking a piece, protecting pieces, if it can be moved onto one
of the sides of the board, etc...
 
\item Python Frontend: The Python frontend will receive data by piping stdin/stdout to/from the Python.
The chess program will be able to send and receive messages to Python which will take actions based upon
those messages to update the game board and send key presses to the MIPS backend.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Project Breakdown}
Matt: Will be responsible for the state machine and the datastructures.\\
\\
Pat: Will be responsible for the AI implementation and the Python frontend.
